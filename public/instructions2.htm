      <h3>Bonus Conversion</h3>

      The game is repeated <span id="rounds-count">X</span> rounds, in
      each of which you can earn up to a maximum payoff
      of <strong>100</strong> ECU. Your final bonus is equal to the
      sum of payoffs collected in each round.

      <br/>
      <br/>

      ECU are converted to US dollars with a factor
      of <span id="ecu-conversion">X</span> to 1, so that you need to
      collect <span id="ecu-conversion-2">X</span> ECU to win 1
      dollar.


      <h3>Final Guidelines</h3>

      <div id="payoff-info">
        <em>Attention!</em> To ensure that you receive your pay:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Do not use the "Back Button" of your browser during the game.
          </li>
          <li>
            Do not open multiple tabs.
          </li>
          <li>
            If your browser crashes or your connection goes down, you
            can reconnect any time until the game is finished. All the
            rounds that you don't play will not be added to your final
            payoff.
          </li>
          <li>
            You need to play at least 50% of the rounds and be
            connected during the last round to receive your payment.
          </li>
        </ul>
        </div>
