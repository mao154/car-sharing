      This game is played by <span id="players-count">X</span> human players, in the role of
      commuters who must reach their destination before 12:00 am. Two
      options are available:

      <br/><br/>

      <ul>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">
          <strong style="font-size: 18px">Public Transport by
          Bus</strong>: 2 hours travel time, departure time is fixed: 10:00 am.
        </li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px">
          <strong style="font-size: 18px">Car Sharing
          Service</strong>: 1 hour travel time, departure time between
          10:00 and 11:00 am.
        </li>
      </ul>

      You will get a payoff for reaching your destination as close as
      possible to 12:00 am, and with as little travel time as
      possible. Therefore, you get the highest payoff when you arrive
      at 12:00 with one hour of travel time by car. However, <em>the
      number of available cars is limited!</em>

      <br/><br/>

      The earlier you arrive to the car sharing site, the higher is
      the chance to find a car available. However, the advantage of
      the shorter travel time by car is reduced because you will reach
      your destination too early.

      <br/><br/>

      If you arrive to the car sharing site and there are no cars
      left, you are forced to take the next bus and you will arrive
      with an according delay.
