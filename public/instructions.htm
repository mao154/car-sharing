      This game is played by <span id="players-count">X</span> human players, in the role of
      commuters who must reach their destination before 12:00PM. Two
      options are available:

      <br/><br/>

      <ul>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 10px">
          <strong style="font-size: 16px">Public Transport by
          Bus</strong>: 2 hours travel time, departure time fixed: 10:00AM.
        </li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px">
          <strong style="font-size: 16px">Car Sharing
          Service</strong>: 1 hour travel time, departure time flexible
          (10:00 -11:00AM).
        </li>
      </ul>

      You will get a payoff for reaching your destination as close as
      possible to 12:00PM, and with as little travel time as
      possible.

      <br/><br/>

      <em>Notice!</em> The number of cars available at the car sharing
      site is limited<span id="car-amount"></span>. Therefore the
      earlier you arrive to the car sharing site, the higher is the
      chance to find a car available. However, the advantage of the
      shorter travel time by car is reduced if you reach your
      destination too early.

      <br/><br/>

      <h4>Payoff Computation</h4>

      <div id="payoff-info">


      <ul>
        <li>
          Taking the car at 10:00AM, therefore arriving one hour early,
          gives you <span id="payoff-car">X</span>% of the maximum
          payoff.
        </li>
        <li>
          Taking the car at 11:00AM, therefore arriving to
          destination at 12:00PM with 1 hour travel time, gives you
          the <strong>maximum</strong> payoff.
        </li>
        <li>
          Taking the car between 10:00 and 11:00AM gives you a payoff
          between <span id="payoff-car-2">X</span>% and <strong>100</strong>% of the
          maximum payoff.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you arrive to the car sharing site and there are no cars
          available, you are forced to take the next bus. You will
          arrive with an according delay and with a payoff
          between <strong>0</strong>
          and <span id="payoff-not-car">X</span>% of the maximum
          payoff.
        </li>
        <li>
          Taking the bus at 10:00AM always gives you
          <span id="payoff-bus">X</span>% of the maximum payoff.
        </li>
        </ol>
